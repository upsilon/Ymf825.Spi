= Ymf825.Spi

Ymf825.Spi provides access to link:https://yamaha-webmusic.github.io/ymf825board/intro/[YMF825Board] functionality for link:https://dotnet.github.io/[.NET Core] **based on link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Device.Gpio/[System.Device.*] APIs**. :notes:

== :bulb: Introduction

This library provides additional components for link:https://github.com/nanase/ymf825[nanase/Ymf825].
It uses _pre-released_ link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Device.Gpio/[System.Device.*] APIs to access GPIO pins and SPI bus.

It is intended to operate the YMF825Board from devices that have support SPI natively such as Raspberry Pi.

If you want to use YMF825Board from PC *over USB-SPI adapter*, you should use the Ymf825 built-in components such as link:https://github.com/nanase/ymf825/blob/feature/2.0/Ymf825/IO/AdafruitFt232hInterface.cs[AdafruitFt232HInterface] class and no need to use this library.
